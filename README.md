# Friend Bot Project

Welcome to the **Friend Bot Project**! This project integrates various hardware components such as a camera, ultrasonic sensors, and motors, along with software functionalities like voice recognition, to create an interactive and responsive bot. The bot can perform tasks based on voice commands, sense its surroundings using sensors, and interact with users through various outputs.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition:** The bot can understand and respond to voice commands.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to detect and measure distance from obstacles.
- **Motor Control:** Controls motors based on sensor input and voice commands.
- **Camera Functionality:** Captures images or video using the PiCamera.
- **Combined Functionality:** The `final_combined_code.py` script integrates all the different components into a cohesive system.

## Project Structure

- `Picamera.py`: Script to control the PiCamera for capturing images or video.
- `final_combined_code.py`: The main script that integrates voice recognition, motor control, and sensor input to operate the bot.
- `motor and ultrasonic sensor.py`: Script to control the motor based on input from an ultrasonic sensor.
- `ultrasound.py`: Handles operations related to the ultrasonic sensor.
- `voice_recognition.py`: Implements voice recognition functionality to allow the bot to respond to spoken commands.
- `.idea/`: Project settings and configuration files (IDE-specific).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- Required hardware components such as PiCamera, ultrasonic sensors, and motors.
- A microphone for voice input.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/michx02/-Friend-Bot--Project.git
   cd Friend-Bot-Project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Hardware**

   Ensure all hardware components (camera, sensors, motors, microphone) are properly connected to your system.

## Usage

1. **Running the Combined Code**

   To run the bot with all integrated features, use:

   ```bash
   python final_combined_code.py
   ```

   This script will enable the bot to listen for voice commands, interact with its environment through sensors and motors, and respond accordingly.

2. **Individual Components**

   You can also run individual scripts to test specific functionalities:

   - **Voice Recognition:** `python voice_recognition.py`
   - **Camera:** `python Picamera.py`
   - **Motor and Sensor:** `python motor\ and\ ultrasonic\ sensor.py`

## Dependencies

Make sure to install all dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file. If the file is missing, common libraries might include:

- `opencv-python` (for camera handling)
- `speech_recognition` (for voice commands)
- `RPi.GPIO` (for GPIO pin control on Raspberry Pi)
- `pyaudio` (for audio input)
